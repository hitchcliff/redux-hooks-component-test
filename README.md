## Test of a component with Redux Hooks

I faced the question of how to test component that used Redux Hooks. To deal with it I extended recipe from React Testing Library.

[RTL. React Redux Recipe](https://testing-library.com/docs/example-react-redux)


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
