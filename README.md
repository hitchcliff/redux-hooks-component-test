# Test of a component with Redux Hooks

I faced the question of how to test component that used Redux Hooks. To deal with it I extended recipe from React TestingÂ Library.

Perhaps I'll add Sagas and Typescript.

<br />

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
